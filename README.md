## Looking Glass - what is it for?
Looking Glass is an app for movie (and, in the future, all media) fanatics and casual viewers alike. Looking Glass takes care of the problem of keeping track of all the things you want to watch, the things your friends tell you you should want to watch, and the things you've enjoyed.

## How do I run it?
Run: 
``
npm install
``
``
bundle install
``
``
rails db:migrate
``
``
rails s
``
